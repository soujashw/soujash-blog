        <h2>Living the Boring Life</h2>
        <small>Posted on July 6, 2025</small>
        <p>Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to have very little stress in your daily life? There is a secret to making this come true, and it may not necessarily be the answer some are looking for: living the boring life. Let‚Äôs be honest, would it be more fun to go out to a movie theater and watch a movie, or would it be more fun to sit at home and finish all of your chores? I am sure you know the answer most people will give. Now imagine stepping into office the next day not having finished the project. How will that feel? Stressful, right? I am sure you get where I am heading. Let‚Äôs say someone stole an item from a shop. For a while, that person will always be scared and stressed whenever they see law enforcement or any signs of there being laws. Just imagine if that person wouldn‚Äôt have stole. That individual wouldn‚Äôt have had all of that stress on their shoulders. Therefore, living the boring life is the life of minimal stress. I am not saying that everyone must agree to this: everyone should live the life they like. I am only saying that if reducing stress is a priority, this is a really good technique. </p>

        <h2>Self-Dependence</h2>
        <small>Posted on June 22, 2025</small>
        <p>This is an unfortunate truth: not all of us have backbone family or friends to support us during the tough times of our life. During these times, people often feel lost. Unsure about how their problems are going to be solved: unsure about when they will be happy again. This is the time when you need to call your best of friends: yourself. You should be your best friend. You are your biggest advocate. When there is no one else in your life to support you, you should be there to support and stand up for yourself!</p>

        <h2>Gratefulness</h2>
        <small>Posted on June 8, 2025</small>
        <p>What exactly is gratefulness? Gratefulness define being thankful for everything in life- from the big things like family to the smallest of things like getting hot coffee in the morning. Gratefulness is important to keep at all times because we never really know when it is all going to come to an end. For example, we could be in a car accident tomorrow, and today could be our last day on Earth. Would you enjoy it with family or spend that time worrying about the future, the past, or what people think? I hope this is some food for thought!</p>
